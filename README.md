This project is done for Cricket and Coding Contest organised by IIT Madras. The task is to create a prediction model preferably a pretrained one, to predict the score of a team, given the names of batsmen, bowlers, venue and all other necessary details.  
## Training Data  
The datasets used for training were obtained from their official site.
